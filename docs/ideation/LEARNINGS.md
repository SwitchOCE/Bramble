### 6 Nov 16:10 — Codex hangs on an open stdin; one image takes about 45 s

**What happened:** `codex exec` run from a background shell with a prompt argument produced nothing in 400 s. The same call with `</dev/null` made a 1.5 MB PNG in 43 s.
**Why:** it waits on stdin when stdin is left open, even with the prompt given as an argument. Closing stdin was the only change, so this is the likely cause rather than a proven one.
**Next time:** always `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check -s workspace-write -C <dir> "<prompt>" </dev/null`. `tools/art/run-codex-image.ps1` needs PowerShell, which this machine doesn't have. At 45 s each, 100 portraits take about 75 minutes one at a time; a few parallel runs are fine, since the work is remote.
