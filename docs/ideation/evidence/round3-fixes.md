# Round 3 fixes

Scope: agreed build-2 review findings, in the requested order. No Ooze/Bird strength tuning and no tribes 5/6. Work stays on `ideation/round3`.

## Method

`tools/sim/round3_probe.gd`: 12 all-Hard lobbies, seeds 41–52; opening plans rotate by seat/seed (32 seats each). Original queue bug fixed for this baseline; balance settings are unchanged. Shops: 10,000 full-pool shops per tavern tier, seed 41; each shop returns its copies before the next. Simulations run in bounded background tool sessions on CPU 2, with a 900-second hard timeout. This is a small diagnostic sample, not a balance verdict. Raw JSON is under `build/round3/`.

## 1. Rule clarity

Golden Changeling firing twice was a bug: a change of side caused the second queue to revisit it. Both initial queues are now captured before triggers. Its one +4/+4 bonus correctly lasts through its return until the fight ends; no permanent recruit buff is applied. Added a 20-seed regression across start orders.

Added glossary reminders, named Shy departure and Nest-loss feedback, explicit front/behind geometry and Seven Whistlers' exclusion of hand Birds. Fight end names the empty board and survivors; unchanged stat text and raw no-room card ids are suppressed. Pipkin warns when the second unit buy uses the cap. Stable CLI `@handle` plays survive buys; removed handles refuse instead of choosing another card. Numeric positions remain for old saves.

Baseline opening placements: tempo **4.156**, economy **4.531**, climb **4.812**, 32 seats each. Baseline late losses reached **33** damage. Shop and per-round comparisons follow in their item sections.
